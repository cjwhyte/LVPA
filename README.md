# A Burst-dependent Thalamocortical Substrate for Perceptual Awareness

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the modelling and analysis described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.13.548934v5.

Stand-alone scripts demonstrating the basic operation of the threshold detection and visual rivalry simulations can be found in the [Minimal_Models folder](https://github.com/cjwhyte/LVPA/tree/main/Minimal_Models)

The full code necessary to reproduce all simulations reported in the paper can be found as follows:
 - Threshold detection simulations in the [LVTD folder](https://github.com/cjwhyte/LVPA/tree/main/LVTD)
 - Visual rivalry simulations in the [LVBR folder](https://github.com/cjwhyte/LVPA/tree/main/LVBR)
 - Supplementary simulations can be found in the [Supplementary_Material folder](https://github.com/cjwhyte/LVPA/tree/main/Supplementary_Material)

The threshold detection simulations use the function script [ThalamoCorticalParams.m](https://github.com/cjwhyte/LVPA/blob/main/LVBR/ThalamoCorticalParams.m) which is included in the LVBR folder, so both folders will need to be added to the MATLAB path.
